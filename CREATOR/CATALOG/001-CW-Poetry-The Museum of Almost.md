The Museum of Almost
They built it overnight—
a shrine to half-finished songs
and letters with no address,
walls lined with the echoes
of things people almost said.

The curator walks me through:
"This exhibit," she says,
"features the promises
that never outran
the hangovers they were born in."
Behind glass, a woman holds
a suitcase she never opened.
A man grips a steering wheel
but never drives away.

In the corner, there’s a pile
of unanswered prayers,
stitched together like a quilt
you can’t sleep under.
The tags read:
"Keep the house."
"Quit drinking."
"Call her back."

I pause at a pedestal,
a typewriter with dust in the keys.
"Who did this belong to?" I ask.
The curator shrugs.
"Everyone," she says,
"or no one. Does it matter?"

I nod, because she’s right.
Almosts belong to everyone—
a collective failure,
a universal sigh.

As I leave, she hands me a brochure:
"Visit again," she says, smiling.
"Your next exhibit is already waiting."
