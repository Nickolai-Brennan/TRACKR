**A Fine Day for a Funeral**  

The day Margaret Fitz’s cat died, she figured she might as well bury it alongside her pride. She wrapped the stiff body in a frayed kitchen towel, the one with coffee stains and holes burned into its corners, and set it on the dining table like a loaf of stale bread. There was no sadness in her movements, only a sense of duty, like she was taking out the trash.  

She called her neighbor, Bob, who lived two doors down and thrived on the misfortune of others. Bob showed up in his threadbare flannel, smelling faintly of whiskey and a lifetime of bad decisions. He leaned in through the doorway before she could even open it all the way.  

“Rough day, huh?” he said, peering over her shoulder.  

“It’s dead,” she replied, nodding toward the towel-wrapped lump on the table. “Thought I’d give it a proper sendoff.”  

Bob scratched his chin, then his crotch, and considered her words like they were part of a philosophical debate. “You gonna say a few words?”  

Margaret shrugged. “It’s a cat, Bob. It wasn’t the Pope.”  

But Margaret knew what he was really asking. Bob didn’t come over for the cat. He came because he’d caught her once, years ago, standing in the backyard talking to the begonias like they were old friends. He probably figured a woman who eulogized flowers would have something colorful to say about a dead tabby.  

“Fine,” she said. “You want a speech? I’ll write a speech.”  

Bob grinned and followed her to the backyard, where the grass grew in patches like an old man’s hairline. She dug the hole herself, sweating through her blouse, while Bob stood by holding a cigarette like a priest with a candle.  

When the grave was ready, she went back inside, grabbed the cat, and plunked it into the dirt without ceremony. Then she cleared her throat.  

“This is Mittens,” she began, gesturing toward the shallow pit. “He was a bad cat. Scratched the furniture, puked in my shoes, and pissed on the carpet every Christmas. He hated me, and I hated him. But we had an understanding. He stayed alive. I stayed distracted. And now he’s dead, and I’m not sure what the hell I’m supposed to do with myself.”  

Bob nodded solemnly, his cigarette dangling from his lips.  

“That’s it,” she said. “That’s the speech.”  

Bob clapped anyway, slow and deliberate, like he was at the opera. Margaret shot him a look but didn’t bother telling him to stop.  

Later, when Bob had wandered back to his own life and Margaret sat alone on her couch with a glass of cheap wine, she felt a strange sense of relief. Not because the cat was gone, but because for the first time in years, she’d said something true out loud.  

And that was the funny thing, she thought, as she stared at the blank TV screen. Sometimes it took a dead cat to dig up the parts of yourself you thought were already buried.
